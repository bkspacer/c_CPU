Hello, I'm sorry for my mistakes in english, but project author asked me to write this not in Russian

I couldn'n find mistakes and disadvantages in this project, so I'll discribe features I've enjoyed the most.
Project contains three base code blocks: assembler, processor, disassembler.
I'll describe them in this order.
  1. Assemler prog is able to compile prog which was written by user into processor code, processor runs compiled program (it is emulation of 
  physical stack processor), diassembler converts output numeric code into understandable form which were set by user. 
  Deep description of each of them working will be boring, so I accent that every prog action is accompanied by well-detailed log
  and dump files with colored markers. Notisfaction: colors works only in Linux, and this part (probably it's only one) isn't cross-platform.  
  
  2. Than, the greatest feature - manual for his own assembler language. It is very detalaize, contains descrition of all functions used in assemler and project to-do list. There are also an opportunity to include user functions into his own file with manual template.
  
3. Every function in source is documentated by doxygen, source has pleasant formatting and is easy-read. In conclusion, XFireFall created perfect project, and he shows his high programming culture and skill. Well done!
